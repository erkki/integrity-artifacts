== Immediate Tasks
* spec and re-write/refactor code based on the prototype
* set up integrity build with metrics for this notifier
* add more explanation to the README

== Future Tasks
* helpers to check for coverage/metric regression
* explicit support for other artifact types
* remove dependency on jeweler
* move some/all of the config options into the integrity interface
* configurable logger?

== Questions
* Is a notifier the best place to do this? Is there another option?
